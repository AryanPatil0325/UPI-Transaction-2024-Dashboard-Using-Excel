# 📊 UPI Transaction 2024 Dashboard – Excel Project

## 📂 Project Overview

This project is an interactive **Excel dashboard** built to analyze UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions across India for the year 2024. The dashboard provides key insights into transaction patterns, success rates, safety status, transaction types, and user demographics, helping UPI-based companies and fintech stakeholders make informed decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To analyze UPI transaction trends **state-wise, age-wise, and day-wise.**
* To identify the most commonly used **transaction types** (P2P, P2M, Bill Payment, Recharge).
* To compare transaction volumes across **regular days vs. weekends.**
* To assess the **safety status** by identifying fraud vs. safe transactions.
* To evaluate **age group participation** in India’s cashless economy.


## ✅ Key Features and KPIs

* **Total Transactions:** Overall UPI transaction volume.
* **Average Transaction Amount:** Average amount per transaction (₹).
* **Age Group-wise Transactions:** Cross-analysis of sender and receiver age groups.
* **Safety Status:** Distribution of safe vs. fraud transactions.
* **Transaction Status:** Success vs. failure transaction rates.
* **Week-wise Transaction Trends:** Transaction distribution across each day of the week.
* **Regular vs. Weekend Analysis:** Comparison of weekday vs. weekend transaction volumes.
* **Most Done Transaction Type:** Donut chart showing P2P, P2M, Bill Payment, and Recharge transactions.
* **Monthly Slicer:** Dynamic month-wise filtering.

## 🔍 Transaction Pattern Identification

The dashboard identifies **transaction patterns** across multiple dimensions:

* **User Behavior Patterns:**
  Through age group analysis of senders and receivers.
* **Time-based Patterns:**
  By comparing weekdays vs. weekends and analyzing day-wise transaction distribution.
* **Category-wise Patterns:**
  By tracking the most frequent transaction types (P2P, P2M, Bill Payments, Recharge).
* **Monthly Trends:**
  Using slicers to observe transaction trends and volumes across different months.

This helps uncover which user groups are most active, which transaction types dominate, and on which days transactions peak.
